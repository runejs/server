# RuneJS Game Server

RuneJS is a RuneScape game server written in TypeScript and JavaScript. The aim of this project is to create a game server that is both fun and easy to use, while also providing simple content development systems.

The game server currently runs a build of RuneScape from October 30th-31st, 2006 (game build #435). No other builds are supported at this time, but may become available in the future.

**RuneJS is completely open-source and open to all pull requests and/or issues. Many plugins have been added by contributor pull requests and we're always happy to have more!**

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- [`docker`](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [`docker-compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
  - If on Windows, `docker-compose` comes with `docker`

1. Copy the `config/server-config.example.json` and paste it into the same folder using the name `server-config.json`
2. Go into your new `server-config.json` file and modify your RSA modulus and exponent with the ones matching your game client
  - You may also modify the server's port and host address from this configuration file
3. Build the docker image with `docker-compose build`
4. Run the game server with `docker-compose up'

The game server will spin up and be accessible via port 43594.

## Game Client

The [RuneScape Java Client #435](https://github.com/runejs/refactored-client-435) must be used to log into a RuneJS game server.
